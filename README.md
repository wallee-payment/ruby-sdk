# wallee Ruby Library

The wallee Ruby library wraps around the wallee API. This library facilitates your interaction with various services such as transactions, accounts, and subscriptions.

## Documentation

[wallee Web Service API](https://app-wallee.com/doc/api/web-service)

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.2+

## Installation

# RubyGem install (recommended)

```sh
$ gem install wallee-ruby-sdk
```

## Usage
The library needs to be configured with your account's space id, user id, and secret key which are available in your [wallee
account dashboard](https://app-wallee.com/account/select). Set `space_id`, `user_id`, and `api_secret` to their values:

### Configuring a Service

```ruby
require 'wallee-ruby-sdk'

space_id = 405
app_user_id = 512
app_user_key = "FKrO76r5VwJtBrqZawBspljbBNOxp5veKQQkOnZxucQ="

Wallee.configure do |config|
  config.user_id = app_user_id
  config.authentication_key = app_user_key
end

# TransactionService
transaction_service = Wallee::TransactionService.new
# TransactionPaymentPageService
transaction_payment_page_service = Wallee::TransactionPaymentPageService.new
```

To get stated with sending transactions you can review the example below:

```ruby
require 'wallee-ruby-sdk'

space_id = 405
app_user_id = 512
app_user_key = "FKrO76r5VwJtBrqZawBspljbBNOxp5veKQQkOnZxucQ="

Wallee.configure do |config|
    config.user_id = app_user_id
    config.authentication_key = app_user_key
end

# TransactionService
transaction_service = Wallee::TransactionService.new
# TransactionPaymentPageService
transaction_payment_page_service = Wallee::TransactionPaymentPageService.new

transaction = Wallee::TransactionCreate.new({
    billingAddress: Wallee::AddressCreate.new({
